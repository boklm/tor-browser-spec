============ Firefox Android Portion =============

Android Java calls
 - URLConnection
   - XXX: getInputStream? other methods?
 - HttpURLConnection
 - UrlConnectionDownloader
 - ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.impl.client.* (look for execute() calls)
 - grep -n openConnection\( mobile/android/thirdparty/
 - java.net.URL -- has SEVERAL proxy bypass URL fetching methods :/
 - java.net
 - javax.net
 - ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.conn.* (esp ssl)
 - ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.impl.conn.* (esp ssl)
 - Sudden appearance of thirdparty libs:
   - OkHttp
   - Retrofit
   - Glide
   - com.amitshekhar.android
 - IntentHelper
   - openUriExternal (can come from GeckoAppShell too)
   - getHandlersForMimeType
   - getHandlersForURL
   - getHandlersForIntent
 - android.content.Intent - too common; instead find launch methods:
   - startActivity
   - startActivities
   - sendBroadcast
   - sendOrderedBroadcast
   - startService
   - bindService
 - android.app.PendingIntent
 - android.app.DownloadManager
 - ActivityHandlerHelper.startIntentAndCatch

============ Regression/Prior Vuln Review =========

Review proxy bypass bugs; check for new vectors to look for:
 - https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-proxy
   - Look for new features like these. Especially external app launch vectors
