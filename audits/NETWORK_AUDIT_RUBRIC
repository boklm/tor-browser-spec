`git diff esrA esrB` and then go over all the changes containing the
below mentioned potentially dangerous calls and features. Grep the diff for
the following strings and examine surrounding usage.

=============== Native DNS Portion =============

PR_GetHostByName
PR_GetIPNodeByName
PR_GetAddrInfoByName
PR_StringToNetAddr (itself is good as it passes AI_NUMERICHOST to getaddrinfo. No resolution.)

MDNS
TRR (DNS Trusted Recursive Resolver)

Direct Paths to DNS resolution:
nsDNSService::Resolve
nsDNSService::AsyncResolve
nsHostResolver::ResolveHost

============ Misc Socket Portion ==============

SOCK_
SOCKET_
_SOCKET
UDPSocket
TCPSocket
  PR_NewTCPSocket
  AsyncTCPSocket

Misc PR_Socket

=========== Misc XPCOM Portion ================

Misc XPCOM (including commands for pre-diff review approach)
 *SocketProvider
 grep -R udp-socket .
 grep -R tcp-socket .
 grep for tcpsocket
 grep -R "NS_" | grep SOCKET | grep "_C"
 grep -R "@mozilla.org/network/" . | grep socket | grep -v udp-socket

============ Rust Portion ================

Rust
 - XXX: What do we grep for here? Or do we rely on Ritter's compile-time tool?
 - Check for new sendmsg and recvmsg usage

============ Android Portion =============

Android Java calls
 - URLConnection
   - XXX: getInputStream? other methods?
 - HttpURLConnection
 - UrlConnectionDownloader
 - ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.impl.client.* (look for execute() calls)
 - grep -n openConnection\( mobile/android/thirdparty/
 - java.net.URL -- has SEVERAL proxy bypass URL fetching methods :/
 - java.net
 - javax.net
 - ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.conn.* (esp ssl)
 - ch.boye.httpclientandroidlib.impl.conn.* (esp ssl)
 - Sudden appearance of thirdparty libs:
   - OkHttp
   - Retrofit
   - Glide
   - com.amitshekhar.android
 - IntentHelper
   - openUriExternal (can come from GeckoAppShell too)
   - getHandlersForMimeType
   - getHandlersForURL
   - getHandlersForIntent
 - android.content.Intent - too common; instead find launch methods:
   - startActivity
   - startActivities
   - sendBroadcast
   - sendOrderedBroadcast
   - startService
   - bindService
 - android.app.PendingIntent
 - android.app.DownloadManager
 - ActivityHandlerHelper.startIntentAndCatch

============ Regression/Prior Vuln Review =========

Review proxy bypass bugs; check for new vectors to look for:
 - https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-proxy
   - Look for new features like these. Especially external app launch vectors
