============ General =============

The audit begins at the commit hash where the previous audit ended. Use
code_audit.sh for creating the diff and highlighting potentially problematic
code. The audit is scoped to a specific language (currently C/C++, Rust,
Java/Kotlin, and Javascript).

The output includes the entire patch where the new problematic code was
introduced. Search for "XXX MATCH XXX" to find the next potential violation.

code_audit.sh contains the list of known problematic APIs. New usage of these
functions are documented and analyzed in this audit.
